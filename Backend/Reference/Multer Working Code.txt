This is for addproduct API.

When someone submits form data to the /upload endpoint, here's what happens step by step:


1. Client Submits Form Data

The client submits a form with multipart/form-data encoding. 
This form includes a file input with the name 'product'. The HTTP POST request is sent to the /upload endpoint.

2. Express Middleware Handles the Request:

The request hits the /upload endpoint, which is handled by the route defined in your Express application.

3. multer Middleware Processes the Upload

The upload.single('product') middleware processes the file upload. Here's what happens internally:

. multer reads the form data, including the file.
. multer uses the configured diskStorage storage engine to determine where to save the uploaded file and what to name it.
. The destination function or value (in this case, ./upload/images) determines the directory where the file will be stored.
. The filename function generates a unique filename based on the field name, current timestamp, and original file extension.
. multer saves the file to the specified directory with the generated filename.
. Once multer has processed and saved the file, this route handler is called,
. res.json({
        success: 1,
        imageUrl: `http://localhost:${port}/images/${req.file.filename}`
    });
